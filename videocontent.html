With both Osmos we were able to make nice shots from city, while driving and environment around to make watcher more emphatic with experience. And Drone we decided to use to break usual videos and bring a bit of air to video.</p>

                <p>We decided to not use video as real guidance, because video were supposed be placed on website, were we explain important rules and give recommendation for place to visit. </p>
                <p>That why we made video to persuade people read rest of website with these rules, tips and tricks.</p>
