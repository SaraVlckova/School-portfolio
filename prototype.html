Project was created for CPH Commune, with already prepared design style guide, what give us another experience with creating website based on requirements.</p>

                <p>First step was do research of all documentation and brochure what we got from CPH Commune and picking up the most important parts to use. </p>
                <p>Out main requirements was keep prepared design guide, so keep font family, icons and rules what Commune is already using for design.</p>
                <p>Our work was a bit easier tanks by wide inspiration of colour and text combination. </p>

                <p>For our design we decided to use green and orange. Green we use as friends colour and to have contrast on white background. Orange is used also for breaking white space, but mostly for pointing all important elements. </p>
                <p>For text we decided to use native blue as main colour of CPH Commune.</p>

                <p>Before actual coding we created two XD Prototypes - for phone and for desktop, to find out how is our user experience - that means easy and clear userâ€™s journey  with feeling of satisfaction. </p>
                <p>On website and tablet we keep using hero video, but phone version was created without hero video to shorten loading time.
                </p>
                <p>After our testing we started coding our final interactive product - website.</p>

            <div class="item textalign-right">
                <p>In coding part we got requirement for using combination of basic languages with JavaScript. In this case we decided implement JavaScript for example to navigation bar, which turn position fixed to position sticky after scroll to specific point on website.</p>
                <p>Because of our page is actually one scroll page, we had to implement automatic scroll to parts of web after click on navigation. This feature took us a bit time to figure out, but we did it! </p>
