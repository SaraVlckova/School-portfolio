              <p>After mobile version I have to developed also version for tablet and desktop, so also management of elements in the best way to keep main design principles as Gestalt principles.</p>
              <p>By using colourful blocks on white background I kept law of figure and symmetry. By using same styling rules for elements as buttons or headings and their following management on website, I kept other laws as closure, connections, proximity or similarity.</p>
              <p>On website I use all visual contrast except texture.</p>

              <p>Before coding part I checked if everything fits to grids which I decided to use. Whole coding part was continuing and expanding code, which I created for project Mobile first.</p>
              <p>Main difference between mobile and desktop version is mainly navigation bar, which is made as burger menu on smaller devices and in typical navigation for desktops.</p>
              <p>A also tried to play with changing colours while user hover over elements to keep website impressive to use, and to keep userâ€™s attention.</p>
