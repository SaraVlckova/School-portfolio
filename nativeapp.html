            <p class="aligncenter textincenter">This project was our last project of first semester. Purpose of this project was come up with app making Kea’s student life easier. Because we were supposed to test idea and create app just as XD Prototype without coding, it allowed us be more open  advanced features of the app, which we would not be able to code yet. Thanks to this, we were able to improve our testing and developing skills.</p>

                <p>In this project we had to do our prototype done by 5 days Design sprint. Each day we had different task to do. Our first day we had brainstorming about what kind of app we wanna do, so we were asking students but also ourselves one question - What are we, as Kea students, missing or what we would appreciate to have for our studies.</p>
                <p>Let’s be honest now and remind yourself how many times you were missing to hear more than just teacher’s feedback or have possibilities to ask for feedback during process of your project. Many times right? </p>

            <div class="item textalign-right">
                <p>That’s why we came with app, which is made as a platform for students, exchange students and teachers to share their project or project process and use three main features of app - Get feedback, Ask for help and stay connected with others. </p>
                <p>Students can help each other by feedback forms or chat in private messages. </p>

                <p>Thanks by more feedbacks, students can improve their self confidence by hearing helpful opinions on their projects. Besides that people can see works other people and find people to cooperate with or just find a new friends.</p>
                <p>For our app we took main inspiration from Bumble - app for meeting people around you.  We inspire by concept and functions, which users know to use, but instead of people we want people swipe between project. </p>

                <p>So we started making light wireframes and we start designing.</p>
                <p>We decided to use pastel green and white colours because it feels friendly and clean. Our colours we also used in gradient to break one tone colour.</p>

                <p>As a logo we used Rocket - which symbolise self-developement and boosting knowledges. There we agreed also on App name - PocketBooster, because this app should be for phones, so it it all time in pocket and helping to boost our knowledges. </p>
                <p>As you can see, we collect all design guide to keep whole app in same mood. For example when we used the rocket icon in our logo, we keep space mood and in rest of design we used space decorative icons as well.
