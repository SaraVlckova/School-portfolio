                <p>Our first group project started by choosing specific movie. Based on movie we create moodpboard and persona collage what we have learned from previous individual project in this theme. </p>
                <p>Persona collage and moodboard helped us to have clear view and build our style and for who we are doing it.</p>
                <p>Next step was agreed on whole concept of game and story. So we went through brainstorming, we pick up our best ideas and start with storyboard.</p>

                <p>Once we were done with storyboard, we started with design of characters, scenarios and elements.</p>
                <p>We decided to divide our team on two designers and two coders to have good working flow and equal tasks. My role in this project was designer.</p>
                <p>In designing part we find first big challenges as division of work to keep our style. In this part we could see differences between characters and scenarios, what learn us how to divide tasks better next time. </p>

                <p>In coding part we had two main coders, but basically all of us we were working on code to understand in every detail.
                </p>
