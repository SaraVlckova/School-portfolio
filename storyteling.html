              <p>After collecting all ideas about character and story I would create, I decided for Buddy Bear and his story about honey. During story board I was supposed to implement Narrative curve which learn me that interesting stories have to go through exposition, raising action, climax following falling action and resolution in the end.</p>
              <p>For designing I chose inspiration in flat design, which is popular, easy and I found it as the most common style to me.</p>

              <p>When I was done with designing all elements of main character, I started with creating sprite sheet where I divided movement to keys, extremes and breakdowns positions, what helped me create more smooth animation than if I would me making is pose by poses.</p>
